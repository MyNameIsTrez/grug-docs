grug is an open-source modding framework designed to make the integration of
mods into an existing project as easy as possible.

grug is also a compiled programming language, making the experience of writing
and maintaining mods as pleasant as possible.

It was designed alognside the writing of this article, and is based on two
modding observations:

1. Most mods just want to add basic content, like more guns and creatures.
2. Most mods just want to run some basic code whenever a common event happens,
   like having a human spawn three explosions after they die.

**Note:** grug is still in early stages of development, so many things about the
design are still in flux, and it currently only supports a limited number of
platforms.
